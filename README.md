A simple modlist for New Vegas built off of The Best of Times to provide a bug-fixed and well performing New Vegas (and more) experience with minimal .esp files. As of right now this is just to provide a baseline to make your own modlist (think [SME](https://thephoenixflavour.com/skyrim-se/sme/) or [FO4ME](https://github.com/GozerBlackCat/FO4ME) without the tools).

Provides support for:
- Fallout: New Vegas
- Fallout: Dust
- Fallout: Tale of Two Wastelands

__Current bugs/issues:__
Modlist goes out of order if not using TTW list, and puts `TTW 3.3.2` and `TTW Quickstart Item Remover - INI` at the bottom in the development section.

__Plans:__
- Provide support for all major total conversions, but these are the most relevant as of __08/04/2023__.
- Provide tools with the installer.
