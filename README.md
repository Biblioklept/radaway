A simple modlist for New Vegas built off of The Best of Times to provide a bug-fixed and well performing New Vegas (and more) experience with minimal .esp files. As of right now this is just to provide a baseline to make your own modlist (think SME(FT) or FO4ME without the tools).

Provides support for:
- Fallout: New Vegas
- Fallout: Dust
- Fallout: Tale of Two Wastelands

__Plans:__
- Provide support for all major total conversions, but these are the most relevant as of __08/04/2023__.
- Provide tools with the installer.
