A simple modlist for New Vegas built off of The Best of Times to provide a bug-fixed and well performing New Vegas (and more) experience with minimal .esp files. As of right now this is just to provide a baseline to make your own modlist (think [SME](https://thephoenixflavour.com/skyrim-se/sme/) or [FO4ME](https://github.com/GozerBlackCat/FO4ME) without the tools).

Provides support for:
- Fallout: New Vegas
- Fallout: Dust
- Fallout: Tale of Two Wastelands

__Current bugs/issues:__
- Modlist goes out of order if not using TTW list, and puts `TTW 3.3.2` and `TTW Quickstart Item Remover - INI` at the bottom in the development section.

Current Response: Adding an empty "textures" folder to both.
- 10mm Pistol(s) has broken sights.

Current Response: Removing `Vanilla Iron Sights Realligned` and solely relying on `Weapon Mesh Improvement Mod`.

__Plans:__
- Provide support for all major total conversions, but these are the most relevant as of __08/04/2023__.
- Provide tools with the installer.
